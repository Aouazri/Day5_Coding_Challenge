# Day5_Coding_Challenge
Day 5 of the #100DaysOfCoding challenge(for Loops, Range and code blocks+project) 
In the final project of Day 5 of the 100 coding challenge, I've created a random password generator
where the user decides how many numbers, symbols and letters would be in the password. You'll find 2 versions in this code: 
1- An easy mode: the password is not randomised (weaker password) 
2- Hard mode: the password is randomised (a strong password)
